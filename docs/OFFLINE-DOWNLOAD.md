# Offline Download Package

This document explains how to download and use the offline package of Aurorae Haven.

## Overview

The offline download package allows you to run Aurorae Haven on your computer **without internet access and without any installation**. After downloading and extracting, you'll need to serve the files with a simple local web server (instructions provided).

This is ideal for:

- **Limited connectivity environments**: Use the app where internet is unavailable or unreliable
- **Archiving**: Keep a snapshot of a specific version
- **Distribution**: Share the app with others who don't have development tools
- **Privacy**: Run completely offline with no external connections
- **No cloud dependencies**: Everything runs on your device

## Download Instructions

### Option 1: Download from Repository Branch (Recommended)

The latest offline package is always available on the `offline-releases` branch:

1. Visit the [offline-releases branch](https://github.com/ayanimea/aurorae-haven/tree/offline-releases)
2. Download the `.tar.gz` file (e.g., `aurorae-haven-offline-v1.0.0.tar.gz`)
3. Click on the file to view it, then click the "Download" button

**Note**: Visit the branch above to see the current version and download directly from there.

### Option 2: Download from GitHub Releases (Stable Versions)

For stable, tagged releases:

1. Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/ayanimea/aurorae-haven/releases)
2. Find the latest release (or the version you want)
3. Download the `.tar.gz` file under "Assets" (e.g., `aurorae-haven-offline-v1.0.0.tar.gz`)
4. Tagged releases are versioned and include changelogs

### Option 3: Download from GitHub Actions (Development Builds)

For the absolute latest build from CI/CD:

1. Visit the [GitHub Actions workflows page](https://github.com/ayanimea/aurorae-haven/actions/workflows/upload-pages-artifact.yml)
2. Click on the most recent successful workflow run (look for a green checkmark ✓)
3. Scroll down to the **Artifacts** section at the bottom of the page
4. Click on `AuroraeHaven` to download the automatically-generated `.zip` file
5. Note: Artifacts expire after 90 days

**Format Note**: GitHub Actions artifacts are automatically packaged as ZIP files by GitHub.

### Option 4: Build Locally (Requires Node.js)

If you have the repository cloned and Node.js installed:

```bash
# Install dependencies (first time only)
npm install

# Build and create offline package
npm run build:offline
```

The package will be created in `dist-offline/` directory.

## Installation Instructions

### Step 1: Extract the Archive

The offline package comes as either a `.zip` or `.tar.gz` archive. Extract it:

**For ZIP files (.zip)** - from GitHub Actions artifacts:

- **Windows**: Right-click → **Extract All...**
- **macOS**: Double-click the file
- **Linux**: `unzip AuroraeHaven.zip`

**For TAR.GZ files (.tar.gz)** - from releases or offline-releases branch:

- **Windows**: Use PowerShell or Command Prompt: `tar -xf aurorae-haven-offline-*.tar.gz` (or use 7-Zip/WinRAR/PeaZip).  
  **Note:** Windows File Explorer does not natively extract `.tar.gz` files.
- **Linux/macOS**: `tar -xzf aurorae-haven-offline-*.tar.gz`

**Note**: ZIP files (from GitHub Actions) and TAR.GZ files (from releases/offline-releases) contain identical content - choose whichever format is available or you prefer!

### Step 2: Start a Local Web Server

⚠️ **Important**: Due to modern browser security restrictions with ES modules, you **cannot** simply double-click `index.html`. You must serve the files through a local web server.

Choose one of the following options (all are simple and require no installation beyond the tool itself):

**Option A: Using Python** (Recommended - usually pre-installed)

```bash
cd path/to/extracted/folder
python3 -m http.server 8000
# Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8000
```

#### Option B: Using Node.js

```bash
cd path/to/extracted/folder
npx serve -p 8000
# Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8000
```

#### Option C: Using PHP

```bash
cd path/to/extracted/folder
php -S localhost:8000
# Then open your browser to: http://localhost:8000
```

**💡 Why is a server needed?**

Modern browsers block ES modules (which this app uses) from the `file://` protocol for security reasons. A local web server serves the files via `http://localhost`, which browsers allow. This is a simple, one-command process that doesn't require any complex setup.

### Step 3: Install as PWA (Optional but Recommended)

Once the app is loaded in your browser:

1. Look for the "Install" button in the address bar or app interface
2. Click "Install" to add Aurorae Haven to your device
3. Launch from your home screen, start menu, or app drawer

**PWA Benefits:**

- Fully offline functionality
- Native app experience
- Faster loading times
- Works even when the server is stopped

## What's Included

The offline package contains:

- **index.html**: Main application entry point
- **assets/**: JavaScript bundles and CSS stylesheets
  - React application code
  - Markdown parser and sanitizer
  - Calendar components
  - Optimized and minified
- **sw.js**: Service worker for offline functionality
- **manifest.webmanifest**: PWA manifest
- **icons**: App icons for PWA installation
- **404.html**: Fallback page for routing

**Total Size**: ~105 KB compressed, ~300 KB extracted

## Technical Details

### Build Process

The offline package is automatically generated during the CI/CD pipeline:

1. Vite builds the React application (`npm run build`)
2. PWA assets are generated automatically (service worker, manifest)
3. All files are bundled and optimized
4. A `.tar.gz` archive is created for releases and the offline-releases branch
5. The archives are uploaded to multiple locations:
   - **Repository Branch**: Pushed to `offline-releases` branch (always available, tar.gz format)
   - **GitHub Releases**: Attached to tagged releases (stable versions, tar.gz format)
   - **GitHub Actions Artifacts**: Available for 90 days (development builds, auto-zipped by GitHub)

### Browser Compatibility

The offline package works in all modern browsers:

- ✅ Chrome/Chromium 90+
- ✅ Firefox 88+
- ✅ Safari 14+
- ✅ Edge 90+

### Offline Functionality

The app includes a service worker that:

- Caches all static assets automatically
- Enables full offline functionality after first visit
- Provides fast loading on subsequent visits
- Handles offline scenarios gracefully

### Data Storage

All user data is stored locally in your browser:

- **IndexedDB**: Tasks, routines, habits, statistics
- **LocalStorage**: Brain dump notes, settings
- **OPFS**: File attachments (if supported)

**Privacy**: No data is sent to external servers. Everything stays on your device.

## Troubleshooting

### Blank page or app doesn't load

**Cause**: Trying to open `index.html` directly without a web server.

**Solution**: You must use a local web server. See Step 2 above for simple one-command options. Opening the file directly (`file://` protocol) will not work due to browser security restrictions with ES modules.

### Service worker not registering

**Solution**: Ensure you're accessing via `http://localhost` or `http://127.0.0.1`, not `file://`

**Why**: Service workers require a secure context (HTTPS) or localhost.

### PWA install button doesn't appear

**Check**:

1. Are you using HTTPS or localhost?
2. Is the app loaded through a web server?
3. Have you visited the site at least once?
4. Does your browser support PWA installation?

### Blank page or errors

**Solutions**:

1. Check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)
2. Clear browser cache and reload
3. Try a different browser
4. Ensure all files were extracted properly

## Updating the Offline Package

To get the latest version:

1. Download a new offline package from GitHub Actions
2. Extract to a new folder (or replace old files)
3. Your data is stored in the browser, not in the app files, so it will persist

**Note**: If you want to backup your data first:

1. Open the current app
2. Go to Settings
3. Click "Export" to save your data as JSON
4. After updating, use "Import" to restore your data

## Security Considerations

- The offline package is a static snapshot of the application code
- All code is open source and can be inspected
- No external network requests are made (except for CDN resources if configured)
- All user data stays on your device
- Content Security Policy (CSP) is enforced to prevent XSS attacks

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need internet to use the offline package?**
A: No! Once extracted and opened, the app works completely offline. The service worker caches everything after the first load.

**Q: Can I share this with others?**
A: Yes! The offline package is freely distributable under the project's license.

**Q: How often should I update?**
