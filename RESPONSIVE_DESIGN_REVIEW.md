  - 3-column grid (200px + 1fr + auto) too tight for mobile
  - Quadrant selector and input field overlapping
  - "Add Task" button truncated on small screens
  - Insufficient padding in matrix quadrants

#### Fixes Applied

```css
/* Mobile portrait - stack form vertically */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .add-task-form {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
    gap: 12px;
  }
  .eisenhower-matrix {
    gap: 10px;
  }
  .matrix-quadrant {
    min-height: 200px;
    padding: 12px;
  }
}
```

#### Result

- ✅ Form stacks vertically for easy input
- ✅ Full-width controls for better touch targets
- ✅ Optimized spacing saves screen real estate
- ✅ Matrix remains 2×2 with better proportions

  - "Calendars", "Day", "Week", "Schedule" buttons wrapping poorly
  - Date display overlapping with buttons
  - Sidebar competing for space with calendar

#### Fixes Applied

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .card .card-h {
    flex-wrap: wrap;
    gap: 8px;
  }
  .layout-schedule {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr;
  }

## Accessibility Improvements

### Font Sizes

**Before:** Some text as small as 11px (0.68rem)  
**After:** Minimum 14px (0.875rem) everywhere

| Element             | Before      | After       | Standard  |
| ------------------- | ----------- | ----------- | --------- |
| Quadrant subtitle   | 11px ❌     | 12px ✅     | ≥12px     |
| Task input (mobile) | 13px ❌     | 14px ✅     | ≥14px     |
| Habit stats         | 0.85rem ❌  | 0.875rem ✅ | ≥0.875rem |

### Touch Targets

All interactive elements maintain ≥48×48px touch targets:

- ✅ Buttons (min-height: 48px)
- ✅ Form controls (min-height: 48px)
- ✅ Checkboxes (48×48px)
- ✅ Navigation tabs (min-height: 48px)

### Motion Preferences

All animations respect `prefers-reduced-motion`:

```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .modal-content {
    animation: none;
  }
}
```

**Implementation:**

```css
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .modal-overlay {
    align-items: flex-end;
  }
  .modal-content {
    border-radius: 16px 16px 0 0;
    animation: modalSlideUp 0.3s ease-out;
  }
}
```

**Example:**

```css
.drawer {
  position: fixed;
  right: 0;
  top: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 80%;
  max-width: 400px;
  transform: translateX(100%);
  transition: transform 0.3s;
}
.drawer.open {
  transform: translateX(0);
}
```

    <!-- Form appears inline -->
  </div>
</div>
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ No context switch
- ✅ Very smooth UX
- ✅ Maintains scroll position
- ✅ Accessible (no focus traps)

**Cons:**

**Example:**

```css
.fullpage-modal {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  right: 0;
  bottom: 0;
  background: var(--bg);
  z-index: 1000;
  animation: fadeIn 0.2s;
}
```

**Pros:**

```css
.toast {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 80px;
  left: 50%;
  transform: translateX(-50%);
  padding: 12px 20px;
  background: var(--glass-hi);
  border-radius: 24px;
  animation: slideUpFade 0.3s;
}
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ Minimal disruption
- ✅ Auto-dismiss available
- ✅ Great for success/error messages
- ✅ Already used in the app

**Cons:**
